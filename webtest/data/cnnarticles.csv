      More than 48,000 people are dead and tens of thousands injured after a massive earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria early on February 6. The magnitude 7.8 quake was one of the strongest to strike the area in more than a century, with Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) calling for international help. A magnitude 6.3 aftershock struck southern Turkey Monday, injuring hundreds more as the region continues to dig out from the rubble.
